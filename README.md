    AssociateProfitSplitter contract
Using Remix Ethereum a smart contract was developed and deployed. The main function of the contract was to accept ether into the contract and have it divided evenly among the accociate level emplyees. This would allow fast and efficient payroll.
Functions: balance and deposit were used to construct this smart contract.
Once the contract was created and deplyed I navigiated to ganache to secure my mneumonic phrase matched the metamask address used to transact ether. Upon confirming a match the deposit was intiated. During the test it is unclear why possibly a technical error along the way. I was unable to send value 101 nor could I send value 1. THe only value accepted to transfer was zero.
